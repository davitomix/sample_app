# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application :rocket:
A Twitter Clone app: Some of the core features of the platform – users, profiles, “following”, posts, and news feed. I also implement sign-in, password reset and account activation <br>
This app was made following the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Built With

- Ruby,
- Ruby on Rails,
- Html, CSS and JS

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
